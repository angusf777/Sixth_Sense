# Sixth Sense Project

## Introduction
Sixth Sense revolutionizes the way disabled individuals interact with their environment through a groundbreaking brain control interface. Utilizing an EEG headband and companion app, this technology enables intuitive communication and control with simple gestures like blinking, enhancing independence and safety.

## Key Features
- **Intuitive Control**: Operate devices and communicate with ease.
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time health tracking with emergency alerts.
- **AI Integration**: Advanced AI for accurate command interpretation.

## Getting Started
To begin using Sixth Sense, wear the EEG headband and connect to the companion app. Perform predefined gestures (e.g., blink twice to send a text) to control your environment.

## How It Works
Sixth Sense captures brainwave signals, processes them through AI algorithms, and translates them into actionable commands, offering a seamless interaction experience.
